# Hassette

Hassette is a modern Python framework for building Home Assistant automations.
Itâ€™s designed to feel like the rest of your Python projects: **async-first, type-safe, and with real logging**.

Think of it as an alternative runtime for automations and apps, similar in spirit to AppDaemon but built with todayâ€™s Python tooling and practices.

## Status

ðŸš§ This project is new and still evolving.
It runs my own automations at home, but the public docs, examples, and packaging are still in progress.

If youâ€™d like to try it out or contribute, please do â€” early adopters and feedback are very welcome.
~~Check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.~~

## What to expect

- Async-first event loop built on `asyncio`
- Strong typing for apps, events, and entities (with room for improvement â€” PRs and ideas welcome!)
- ~~Structured~~ logging and better error visibility
- Scheduler, event bus, and API layer for talking to Home Assistant

## Documentation

Full documentation and examples are coming soon.
In the meantime, the source code is reasonably well-structured. ~~and you can peek at the `examples/` folder for starting points.~~
