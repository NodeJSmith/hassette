## [0.3.1] - 2025-09-07

### Fixed
- Fixed timestamp conversion return types in `InputDateTimeState` attributes
- Removed custom attributes from input number states
- Get AppSync working using anyio.to_thread and `hassette.loop.create_task` to ensure we're on the right event loop

### Internal
- Consolidated input entity states into unified `input.py` module
- `BinarySensorState` now inherits from `BoolBaseState`
- Fixed inheritance issues in `SceneState`, `ZoneState`, and `NumberState`
- Update health service to use a `web.AppKey` instead of a string

### Tests
- get tests against HA instance working in Github Actions
- updated tests for fixed synchronous app handling

## [0.3.0] - 2025-09-04
### Changed
- Update exports to remove long lists of states, events, and predicates
- Still export StateChangeEvent
- Other exports are now under `states`, `events`, `predicates` exports
  - E.g. `from hassette import AttrChanged` becomes `from hassette import predicates` and `predicates.AttrChanged`

  - Battery monitoring example app with sync/async variants
  - Presence detection example with complex scene management
  - Sensor notification example
  - Example `hassette.toml` configuration file
- New `on_hassette_service_started` event handler
- Additional sync API methods for better synchronous app support

### Changed
- Improved README with comprehensive documentation and examples
- Updated pyproject.toml with better PyPI metadata and project URLs
- Enhanced notify service examples and API calls

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Significant changes to state/sensor structure for better type safety
- Made sensor attributes required and always present

### Fixed
- API parity between sync and async methods
- Sensor attribute handling and device class support
- Configuration scope and core initialization

### Internal
- Moved sensor literals into constants module
- Reorganized state models for better maintainability
