Api
===

Async-first API for REST and WebSocket interactions. The service wraps Home Assistant's HTTP and
WebSocket endpoints with typed models so your apps can query and mutate data without hand-building
requests. All calls run on Hassette's asyncio loop and share the same authentication/session that the
framework manages for you.

Key capabilities
----------------
- Retrieve states and entities as rich Pydantic models (with raw variants available when needed).
- Call services with convenience helpers for on/off/toggle as well as the generic
  :meth:`call_service` method.
- Fire custom events, fetch history/logbook records, interact with calendars, render templates, and
  download camera stills.
- Drop down to low-level ``rest_request`` or ``ws_send_and_wait`` helpers when you need direct API
  access.

.. _entity-state-note:

.. caution::

    Hassette uses different terminology than Home Assistant and AppDaemon, in an attempt to reduce confusion regarding states and entities.

    A ``state``, such as what is returned by *get_state()*, is an object representing the current status of an entity, including its attributes and metadata.

    A ``state value``, such as what is returned by *get_state_value()*, is the actual value of the state, e.g., ``"on"``, ``"off"``, ``23.5``, etc.

    An ``entity``, such as what is returned by *get_entity()*, is a richer object that includes the state and methods to interact with the entity, such as calling services on it.

.. note::

    Most API methods will return a typed model. For example, ``get_state`` expects an entity ID and a state model type, and returns an instance of that model.

    .. code-block:: python

       from hassette import states
       light_state = await self.api.get_state("light.bedroom", states.LightState)
       brightness = light_state.attributes.brightness  # float | None

    These methods will have a ``raw`` variant that returns untyped data (``dict`` or ``Any``) if you prefer that style.

    .. code-block:: python

       raw_state = await self.api.get_state_raw("light.bedroom")
       brightness = raw_state["attributes"].get("brightness")  # Any


    An exception to this is ``get_state_value``, which does not accept a model and always returns a raw string from Home Assistant. You can use ``get_state_value_typed`` if you want a typed return value.

States
------
``get_states`` and ``get_state`` convert raw dictionaries into the appropriate
:class:`~hassette.models.states.BaseState` subclasses. Pass the state model you expect to ``get_state``
so you receive the fully typed object. If you just need the primary value, ``get_state_value`` returns
the raw Home Assistant string, while ``get_state_value_typed`` will coerce into your Pydantic model's
``state`` field.

.. code-block:: python

   from hassette import states

   # Bulk fetch every entity as a typed state union
   all_states = await self.api.get_states()

   # Target a specific device with a concrete model
   climate = await self.api.get_state("climate.living_room", states.ClimateState)
   if climate.hvac_action == "heating":
       self.logger.debug("Living room is warming up (%.1fÂ°C)", climate.attributes.current_temperature)

   # Raw access
   temperature = await self.api.get_state_value("sensor.outdoor_temp")

Entities
--------
Entities (:py:mod:`~hassette.models.entities`) wrap a state plus helper methods. ``get_entity`` performs a
runtime check to be sure you requested the right entity model and returns ``None`` if you use
``get_entity_or_none`` and the entity is missing.

.. code-block:: python

   from hassette.models.entities import LightEntity

   light = await self.api.get_entity("light.bedroom", LightEntity)
   await light.turn_on(brightness_pct=30)

   maybe = await self.api.get_entity_or_none("light.guest", LightEntity)
   if maybe is None:
       self.logger.warning("Guest light is not registered")

.. note::

    Entities are on the roadmap but not fully implemented yet, currently there is only ``BaseEntity`` and ``LightEntity``.

Service helpers
---------------
:meth:`Api.call_service` is the lowest-level abstraction for invoking Home Assistant services. Pass
``domain``/``service`` along with a ``target`` dict or additional service data. Convenience wrappers
turn_on/turn_off/toggle simply forward to ``call_service`` and request a response context so you can
inspect the HA ``HassContext``.

.. code-block:: python

   await self.api.call_service(
       "light",
       "turn_on",
       target={"entity_id": "light.porch"},
       brightness_pct=80,
   )

   ctx = await self.api.turn_off("switch.air_purifier")
   self.logger.debug("Service request id=%s", ctx.id if ctx else "n/a")

   # Fire an automation event
   await self.api.fire_event("hassette_custom", {"trigger": "wake"})

.. note::

    Typed service calls are a high priority, but not yet implemented. Most detailed services (e.g. light.turn_on) will be
    implemented in Entity classes to avoid having hundreds of overloads on the Api class.

History and logbook
-------------------
History endpoints accept Whenever ``PlainDateTime``/``Date`` objects, Python ``datetime``/``date``, or
plain strings. ``get_history`` returns normalized :class:`hassette.models.history.HistoryEntry`
instances; ``get_histories`` yields a mapping of entity IDs to entry lists when you need to fetch
multiple series at once.

.. code-block:: python

   from whenever import PlainDateTime

   start = PlainDateTime.now().subtract(hours=2)
   history = await self.api.get_history("climate.living_room", start_time=start)
   for entry in history:
       self.logger.debug("%s -> %s", entry.timestamp, entry.state)

   logbook = await self.api.get_logbook("binary_sensor.front_door", start_time=start)

Templates, calendars, and other REST endpoints
----------------------------------------------
Use the provided helpers instead of building raw URLs:

- :meth:`render_template` renders Jinja templates.
- :meth:`get_camera_image` streams the latest still (or a specific timestamp).
- :meth:`set_state` writes synthetic states (handy for helpers or sensors you manage).
- :meth:`get_calendars` / :meth:`get_calendar_events` expose HA calendar data.

Each helper handles serialization and retries for you.

Low-level access
----------------
If you need an endpoint Hassette does not wrap yet, ``rest_request`` and ``ws_send_and_wait`` provide
direct access to the authenticated ``aiohttp`` session and WebSocket connection. They include retry
logic and raise Hassette-specific exceptions like :class:`hassette.exceptions.EntityNotFoundError` and
:class:`hassette.exceptions.InvalidAuthError` so you can handle failures consistently.

.. code-block:: python

   response = await self.api.rest_request("GET", "config")
   cfg = await response.json()
   await self.api.ws_send_json(type="ping")

Sync facade
-----------
``self.api.sync`` mirrors the async API with blocking calls for synchronous code. Do not call from
within an event loop - it's intended for ``AppSync`` subclasses or transitional code paths (for
example, libraries that expect synchronous hooks).

.. code-block:: python

   # Inside an AppSync or non-async context
   self.api.sync.turn_off("light.bedroom", domain="light")

Typing status
-------------
- Many models and read operations are strongly typed.
- Service calls are not fully typed yet; finishing this is a high priority. For now, ``call_service``
  accepts ``**data`` and performs string normalization for REST parameters.
